Things should achieve

    1. User will ask the HTTP server to start search on some thing eg: - http://localhost:8080?topic=colombo
    2. You've to fetch twitter search results by every 30 secs and save tweeted twitter users
    3. Try to figure out an way to rank those users (whether the no of tweets they send)
    4. Once the user asks for the result show 20 of them (dont worry about the UI) eg:- http://localhost:8080/view
